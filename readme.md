### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** -- since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

One instructor will approve your project before you begin. Please prepare the [pre-project materials.](pre-project-exercise.md)

We will be doing an app [soft launch](/soft-launch.md) two days before the project due date.



### Technical Requirements

Your app needs to:
* **Display a game in the browser**
* be interactive
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**

### Required Deliverables

* A **non-broken game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you'll be getting into.
* **Don't be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you're trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven't solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.


### Agile Workflow
* small problems make large problems easier to solve.
* agile user stories might not be applicable to all games, but there are [console-style game agile workflows](game-exercise.md) available.


### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Concentration
Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

You may be tempted to do a more visually-related dynamic game, but within the curriculum of SEI, a game that is turned based is more relevant to the idea of a web application.

That isn't to say that a turn based game is simple or easy to create or code. For example, if the play of the game is easy to implement, you can simply implement a computer player in the game.

Here are some examples of turn based games with simple game mechanics: [http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/GameSystems4.shtml](http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/GameSystems4.shtml)


### Feedback + Evaluation
The project is meant to demonstrate that everyone is minimally capable of __applying__ the things we saw during class.

Given __Bloom's Taxonomy__ students should be able to apply their knowledge of HTML, CSS and javascript. Students must remember enough of the concepts to to understand how to apply their knowledge / build this project.
